## About the pganalyze Log Classification System

Internally in pganalyze each log line gets assigned one of the classifiers below, to uniquely identify the circumstances under which such an event was triggered. These classifications are then used for alerting and filtering purposes, and allow you to quickly find the corresponding documentation for an event.

Note that this log classifier is generated by pganalyze and not something thats part of Postgres itself.

Those familiar with [SQL error codes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/errcodes-appendix.html) (SQLSTATE) might ask themselves: Why invent yet another log line classification system?

In our experience working with PostgreSQL, whilst the SQL error codes in logs are useful (if they are being output), they unfortunately cover less than 50% of the useful log events we encountered. Where available this documentation includes a reference to the corresponding SQLSTATE code, so you can match it up.
